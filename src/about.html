        <p>Looking for a job is hard enough as it is, and we are here to help with that. Normally, you have to spend hours
            and hours sifting through LinkedIn and other websites just to find jobs to apply to, let alone finding
            ones that are the right fit for you. Our goal is to create an interactive, easy to use website where users can 
            simply drag and drop their resume, and find countless results of job listings that are actually relevant to them. 
            Though it will take some time, by the end of this semester we hope to have our project to the point where users can 
            enter their resume, and see personalized results in real time.
